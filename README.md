#custom, static site generator
by [yasha mostofi](http://www.yashamostofi.com/)

after I'm done building this, I'll publish a huge blog post detailing the process.

_specs (apr 13)_
workflow:
- write in markdown
- define variables at top of file
- run python script
- script dumps out html files for use

variable examples:
- `post_image` title and button background for post
- `date`
- `time`
- `author` (support for multiple authors...?)
- `post_title`

**todo**
- figure out a way to parse for variables


_specs (apr 8)_
- python
- markdown
- **lots** of customization
